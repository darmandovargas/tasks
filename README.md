## Tasks Angular 5 Nodejs REST API

This is a CRUD application that uses OAuth authentication login, Angular 5 and NodeJS task CRUD.

It is composed for two parts, the frontend (Angular 5) and the backend (NodeJS and MongoDB), on each folder there are instructions about how to install tha packages and run both servers.

I decided to use NodeJS because it is a very used technology on the market with the MEAN wave, anyhow the best way to build the backend its with Spring Data as its more robust, stable, tailored and reliable.

Thanks for the opportunity !
